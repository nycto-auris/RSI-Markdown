# Markdown & Git for Documentation & Repo

## What is Markdown?

    1. A markup language with simple formatting elements in plain text documents. 
    2. Its the standard for readme files on Github.

## Why Markdown

    1. Its plain text, so any editor can use it, no need for Word or another processor. 
    2. You can pull down files from your repo and read them directly from VScode there without the need for Word. 
    3. Plain text makes the docs smaller.
    4. You can link to other articels, scripts or resources.
    5. Inline code or code blocks are clean and unformated for better pasting to command lines.
    6. Easy viewing in a web browser.

## Why Git for Documention?

    1. Central repo, a single source of truth shared with the team
    2. More easily update or make changes
    3. Collaberation - How many people are sitting on piles of SQL or powershell scripts that they haven't shared?
    4. The documentation lives in the same place as the scripts and code. 

## More context

    1. This assumes that you have access to these repos from inside and outside the environment. 
    2. This also assumes that we may need to have a set of scripts that are pushed to each server as the scripts get improved. 
    3. This assumes that our servers are not our pets and are more like cattle or crops.
